The Bland Saas uses `Supabase` to provide email and password authentication. You will need to create a new Supabase project. You will add the Supabase URL and Supabase key to the `.env` file.

## Create a Supabase project

When you create a Supabase project, authentication with Email and Password will be enabled by default. If it is enabled you will see this in your Supabase dashboard.

## Enable Email and Password

To use Email and Password authentication, you enable it in the `Config` file. 

When a user navigates to the login page, they will see a form to enter their email and password. If the user is not registered, they can click the sign-up link to create an account.

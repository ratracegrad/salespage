The Bland Saas uses `Supabase` to provide Social authentication using Google and GitHub. You will need to create a new Supabase project. You will add the Supabase URL and Supabase key to the `.env` file.

## Create a Supabase project

When you create a Supabase project, you will need to enable social login by selecting an authentication provider in your Supabase dashboard.

Supabase provides very detailed instructions on how to enable social login. Instead of duplicating their instructions here, we recommend you follow their instructions:

[Supabase Auth With Google](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google?queryGroups=environment&environment=server)

[Supabase Auth With GitHub](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github?queryGroups=environment&environment=server)

## Enable Social Login

To use Social authentication, you enable it in the `Config` file. 

When a user navigates to the login page, they will see a button to login with the Social Provider(s) you have enabled.

The Bland Saas uses `Supabase` to provide Magic Link authentication. You will need to create a new Supabase project. You will add the Supabase URL and Supabase key to the `.env` file.

## Create a Supabase project

When you create a Supabase project, you will need to enable Magic Link as an authentication provider in your Supabase dashboard.

Supabase provides very detailed instructions on how to enable Magic Link. Instead of duplicating their instructions here, we recommend you follow their instructions:

## Enable Magic Link

Magic Links are a form of passwordless login where users click on a link sent to their email address to log in to their accounts. Magic Links only work with email addresses and are one-time use only.

To use Magic Link authentication, you enable it in the `Config` file. 

When a user navigates to the login page, they will see a form to enter their email address to authenticate with Magic Link.

The Bland SaaS template comes with a blog feature that allows you to create and manage blog posts. The blog feature is built with Nuxt Content and Tailwind CSS.

## Enabling the Blog Feature

To enable the blog feature, you need to set the `blog` option to `true` in the `Config` file.

```js{}[config/index.js]
  blog: {
    showBlog: true,
    blogTitle: 'From the blog', // title displayed in the blog section
    blogDescription: 'Honi soit qui mal y pense', // description displayed below blog title
    blogPostsPerPage: 10, // make it 0 to disable pagination
    blogShowImages: true,
  },
```

## Creating a Blog Post

To create a blog post, you need to create a markdown file in the `content/blog` directory. The markdown file should have the following front matter:

```yaml{}[content/blog/1.nuxtjs.md]

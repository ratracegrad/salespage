The Bland SaaS uses custom icons to enhance the user experience. These icons are used throughout the website to provide visual cues and to make the website more visually appealing.

## Default Icons

The Bland SaaS uses the [Icones.js](https://icones.js.org/) library to provide a wide range of icons for use throughout the website. The Icones library is a collection of icons that are designed to be used in web applications and websites. The Icones library is open source and can be used for free in any project.

The Bland SaaS defaults to installing only the `@iconify-json/flag`, `@iconify-json/heroicons`, and `@iconify-json/logos` packages.

## Adding More Icons

You can install additional icon packages by following the instructions to install the desired package from the [Icones.js](https://icones.js.org/) website.

## Using Icons

To use an icon in your project, you can use the `Icon` component. The `Icon` component takes a `name` prop that specifies the icon to use. The `Icon` component also takes a `width` and `height` prop that specifies the size of the icon.

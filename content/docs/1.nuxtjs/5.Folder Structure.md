Nuxt.js has a predefined folder structure that you can follow to organize your project. This structure is not mandatory, but it is recommended to follow it to make your project more organized and easier to maintain. The Bland SaaS template follows this structure.

## The Structure

Here are the folders and files that you will find in this template:

- `assets/`: Contains your uncompiled assets such as SCSS, images, or fonts.
- `components/`: Contains your Vue.js components.
- `config/`: Contains your application configuration.
- `content/`: Contains your blog content.
- `lang`: Contains your i18n translations.
- `layouts/`: Contains your layouts.
- `middleware/`: Contains your application middleware.
- `pages/`: Contains your application views and routes.
- `prisma/`: Contains your Prisma schema and migrations.
- `public/`: Contains your static files.
- `server/`: Contains your server-side code.
- `stores`: Contains your Pinia stores.
- `types`: Contains your TypeScript types.

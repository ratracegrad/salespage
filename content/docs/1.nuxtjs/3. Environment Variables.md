Environment variables are a way to store sensitive information in your application. You can store API keys, database credentials, and more in environment variables.

## Creating an Environment File

You will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can copy the `.env-example` file and rename it to `.env`. 

```bash [Terminal]
cp .env-example .env
```

## Adding Environment Variables

The Bland SaaS uses environment variables for:
- Setting the payment provider
- Supabase credentials
- Stripe credentials

You will need to update the environment variables in the `.env` file by replacing `<YOUR_KEY_HERE>` with your actual keys.

```bash [Terminal]
# PAYMENT PROVIDER
# choices are 'lemonsqueezy' or 'stripe'
NUXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_PROVIDER='lemonsqueezy'

# SUPABASE
SUPABASE_URL='<YOUR_KEY_HERE>'
SUPABASE_KEY='<YOUR_KEY_HERE>'
DATABASE_URL='<YOUR_KEY_HERE>'
```

The Bland SaaS was built using `pnpm`. If you prefer yarn or npm, you can still use them. Just replace `pnpm` with `yarn` or `npm` in the commands.

## Quick Start

You will need to clone the template from the repository. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash [Terminal]
git clone https://github.com/The-Bland-SaaS/nuxt-saas-template.git [YOUR_SAAS_NAME]
cd [YOUR_SAAS_NAME]
pnpm install
git remote remove origin
```

## Environment Variables

You will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can copy the `.env-example` file and rename it to `.env`. 

```bash [Terminal]
cp .env-example .env
```

You can then add your environment variables to the `.env` file. 

I have a whole section on environment variables in the documentation. You can check it out [here](/docs/1.nuxtjs/3.Environment-Variables.md).

## Starting the Development Server

You can start the development server by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Designing Your SaaS

You can start designing your SaaS by selecting what items you want to be displayed. You can also add new components, pages, and layouts to the project.

Prisma is a powerful database toolkit that makes it easy to work with databases. The Bland SaaS uses Prisma to interact with the Supabase database. Prisma provides a type-safe and auto-generated query builder that makes it easy to work with databases in a type-safe way.

## Initialize Prisma

The Bland SaaS already has Prisma set up in the project to create tables to store customer and purchase data. To initialize Prisma in your project, run the following command:

```bash
prisma generate
prisma migrate dev
```

This will generate the Prisma client and create the necessary tables in the database.
